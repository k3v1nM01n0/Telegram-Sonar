# Description

Water level sensor using a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect level of water in a tank.
The user receives notifications and alerts via a telegram bot customized depending on the current level of water.
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to determine distance to the water level.
For this project an Arduino library [newPing](./https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/NewPing/) is used.
The sensor is wired to an esp8266 microcontroller.
